Cloud Native Monitoring App
    This Allows you to check your CPU and Memory Performance dynamically and in Real Time
    Buildign an Apllication and Deploy it on Kubernetes

    Architecture Process
        1.Use Python and  Flask and build a web app that shoes the CPU performance adn Memory 
        2.After building Apllication , Containarize it using Docker ,
        3.Create a dockerFile , BUidl Image and Run container Locally
        4.Create a amazon ECRElastic container Registry using Python Boto3 Module
        5.IN ECR , we pushdocker image to store , retrieve and use teh docker images in secure adn efficient manner
        6.In Deployment Phase  , We create elastic kubernetes cluster with nodes and deploy the apllication on kubernetes
        7.Create Deploymetn and service using Python so taht our app is accssed from internet on Kubernetes.


Pre-requisites for the Project
    1.AWS Account 
        We are creating Kubernetes Service ,ECR and deployig on AWS 
    2.Programattic access and AWS configured With CLI 
        Create Access and Secret Access Key , Account-->Securoty Credentials 
        These Keys are required for programattic Access [Access Keys]
        aws configure // access key -->secret key-->regieon,None
        aws iam-list-users //to check which users are present 
    3.Python 3 INstalled
    4.Docker and Kubectl installed 
        Crete Docker file adn Dockerize apllication 
        Kubectl is a Command line tool for kubernetes , to see if our pods and nodes or services are ready or not 
    5.Code Editor
        Any code Editor 



Starting with the Project
    1.Create a app.py file where we get the Cpu and Memory Metric
        Moduels to get these Metrices , we need a module called psutil
        Gets teh cpu and memory of the server 
    2.We will use Flask Framework to create the Apllication 
        Start the flask app 
    3.Create a function that tells if the CPu or mem is >80% or more and make it better 
    4.Create a requirements.txt file to add all the modules we use in the CLoud App 
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
            All teh requireemtns are automatically installed into our project 
       5.Run the localHost:5000 , we see the cpu adn mem utilixation in real time  matric
            Every time we refresh , we get a log thaat i a monitoring apllication crated in python usinf psutil and flask 


    6.Now the basic Skeleton is done , we need to dessign the app 
    7.render_templeate is sued to add styles in Flask APllicaiton
